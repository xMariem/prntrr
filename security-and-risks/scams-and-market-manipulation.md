# Scams & Market Manipulation

We've designed Printr to provide a seamless, decentralized experience , enabling users to create and trade tokens effortlessly. However, with the freedom and innovation of DeFi comes the responsibility to remain vigilant against scams and market manipulation.

You MUST take some extra measures to protect yourself and funds onchain!

Scams and market manipulation happen when bad actors try to deceive users or manipulate token markets for personal gain. While blockchain technology and our platform enables trustless interactions, it does not eliminate the risk of malicious behavior.

By staying informed and applying best security practices, you can significantly reduce exposure to these risks.

### Printr's Commitment

When creators (printoors) launch tokens on our platform, the mechanisms we've put in place ensure the tokens are launched fairly (fair launch).

During the bonding phase, the Printr contract temporarily owns the token to manage its graduation and related processes. We're doing this to ensure everything is fairly managed.

### Your Commitment.

By engaging with Printr, you commit to:

1. **DYOR (Do Your Own Research)** – Always verify contract addresses, audit tokenomics, and assess project legitimacy before interacting with any token.
2. **Hardening Your Wallet Security** – Your wallet is self-custodial, you should protect it.
3. **Avoiding Phishing & Spoofing** – Always triple-check the Printr URL (app.printr.money) , avoid clicking on unverified links.
4. **Identifying Market Manipulation** – Watch out for bot-driven price swings, wash trading, and liquidity spoofing. Be cautious of FOMO-driven pumps and low-liquidity assets that can be easily exploited.
5. **Self-Custody & Smart Decision-Making** – You own your keys, you own your assets. Verify transactions on-chain before confirming and never share your seed phrase.
