# Audits

Printr manages smart contracts across multiple chains to provide the seamless experience you're getting on the app.

Smart contracts provide trustless automation, they're software systems and they can be subject to inherent risks.\\

Smart contract risks are bugs or vulnerabilities in the contract code that could result in unexpected behaviour or loss of funds. All blockchain protocols have some smart contract risk, but best practices can significantly mitigate these risks.

Printr is committed to security and we have implemented various measures to enhance the safety of our smart contracts. While no system can be entirely risk-free, we continuously work to improve security through testing and best practices.

In this view, we've audited our contracts with [Ackee](https://ackee.xyz/). You can confirm and scrutinise the results here.
