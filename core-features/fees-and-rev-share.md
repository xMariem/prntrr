# Fees & Rev Share

At Printr, revenue isn’t just about platform fees. It’s about reinforcing a system where value flows to the right people: **creators, traders, stakers, and the community**. Our model is lean, scalable, and designed to grow with usage, not extract from it.

## Fees Breakdown

<table><thead><tr><th width="203.01953125">Fee Type</th><th width="124.05078125">Amount</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Bonding Curve Fee</td><td><strong>1%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>LP Fee</td><td><strong>0.3%</strong></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Bonding Curve Fee

Every token starts life on a bonding curve. When someone buys or sells, we take a **1% fee**. That’s it. No upfront costs, no hidden taxes.

Here’s how that fee gets split:

* **40%** goes to buybacks (native token)&#x20;
* **25%** goes to the token creator
* **25%** goes to the Memecoin Reserve
* **10%** goes to the core Printr team

This means that **90% of the revenue** is recycled back into the ecosystem. The buyback boosts the native token, the creator share keeps them building, and the Memecoin Reserve backs community-chosen tokens with real potential.

### LP Fee (Post-Graduation)

Once a token graduates from the bonding curve, it transitions to DEX trading - where we collect a **0.3% LP fee** on every swap while keeping the same revenue logic.

That fee is split in two parts:

* **Base tokens (SOL, ETH, BNB, USDC etc.)**\
  Split using the same 40/25/25/10 structure
* **MEME token**\
  Sent directly to stakers as rewards

## Where the Money Goes

Everything we earn ends up in one of four buckets:

<table><thead><tr><th width="152.78125">% Allocation</th><th width="221.69140625">Destination</th><th>Purpose</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>40%</strong></td><td>Native Token Buybacks</td><td>Rewards all early users via an airdrop and strengthens platform ownership</td></tr><tr><td><strong>25%</strong></td><td>Token Creators</td><td>Provides creators an ongoing income stream beyond token dumping</td></tr><tr><td><strong>25%</strong></td><td>Memecoin Reserve</td><td>Supports thriving communities with liquidity, marketing, and infrastructure</td></tr><tr><td><strong>10%</strong></td><td>Printr Core Team</td><td>Funds long-term development and scaling</td></tr></tbody></table>

We’re not just skimming fees. We’re recirculating them to scale faster, reward users harder, and push our native token PRINT as the centrepiece of the entire stack.
