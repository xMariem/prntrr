## Why we exist in the first place.

Memecoins are central to crypto culture. But today, they're getting more and more fragmented with the rise of new single-chain launchpads and new chains. Each new chain creates a silo, each new launchpads further fragments it. Everyone is competing instead of collaborating. Traders miss out due to bridging friction. Liquidity is thin and fractured.

We believe:

* **Memecoins are meant to be global**, not bound to a single chain.
* **Distribution = Growth.** The more chains a meme touches, the bigger it can become.
* **Degens deserve better UX.** Buying, selling, creating, and discovering memecoins should be fast, fun, and smooth.

Thatâ€™s why we built Printr. One place to launch and trade memecoins on every chain.
