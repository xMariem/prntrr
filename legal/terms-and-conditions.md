Last Modified: 24th June 2025

#### Acceptance of the Terms&#x20;

These terms of use are entered into by and between you and Imprensa Ltd. ("**Printr**," "**we**," or "**us**"). The following terms and conditions, together with any documents they expressly incorporate by reference (collectively, "**Terms**"), govern your access to and use of [https://printr.money](https://printr.money/) (the “**Site**”), the Platform and all related tools, applications, data, software and other services provided by us (collectively, the “**Services**”), whether as a guest or a registered user.&#x20;

Please read the Terms of Use carefully before you start to use the Services. **By using the Services, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms (including any Product Terms) and our Privacy Policy, found at** [privacy-policy](https://printr.gitbook.io/printr-docs/legal/privacy-policy "mention") **incorporated herein by reference**. If you do not want to agree to these Terms or the Privacy Policy, you must not access or use our Services.&#x20;

The Services are offered and available to users who are 18 years of age or older and located in jurisdictions where the use and access of the Services do not violate any applicable laws. Further, by using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with Printr and meet all of the foregoing eligibility requirements. If you do not meet all of these requirements, you must not access or use the Services. In particular, Restricted Persons are prohibited from accessing and/or using the Services.

Printr may require you to provide additional information and documents in certain circumstances, such as at the request of any government authority, as any applicable law or regulation dictates, to provide you with a requested service, or to investigate a potential violation of these Terms. In such cases, Printr, in its sole discretion, may disable your account in connection with the Services and block your ability to access or use the Services until such additional information and documents are processed by us. If you do not provide complete and accurate information in response to such a request, we may refuse to restore your access to the Services.

#### Changes to the Terms

We may revise and update these Terms from time to time in our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when we post them, and apply to all access to and use of the Services thereafter.&#x20;

Your continued use of the Services following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept and agree to the changes. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to communicate to you any discontinuation of a Service through the Site or public communication channels. You are expected to check this page from time to time so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.&#x20;

#### Disclaimer

Printr is not a wallet provider, exchange, broker, dealer, financial institution, payments processor, money services business, or creditor, nor does Printr offer or facilitate the offering of any shares or securities through and/or in connection with the Services. Printr provides a peer-to-peer web3 service that allows users to launch and trade Digital Assets on public blockchains. We do not, at any time, have custody over the Digital Assets that you hold or are intending to hold. We also do not have custody or control over the blockchains you are interacting with. **Please ensure that you review the “Risk Warning” section below carefully before you use any of the Services.**&#x20;

#### Accessing the Services and Account Security

We reserve the right to withdraw or amend all or any part of the Services, and any service or material we provide as part of the Services, in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Services is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict user access, including registered user access, to some parts of the Services or the entire Services.

To use our Services, you must use a third-party Digital Asset wallet (the “**Wallet**”) which allows you to engage in transactions on blockchains. You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to the Services.

To access the Services or some of the resources we offer, you may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information. It is a condition of your use of the Services that all the information you provide on the Services is correct, current, and complete. You agree that all information you provide to register with this Services or otherwise, including, but not limited to, through the use of any interactive features on the Services, is governed by our Privacy Policy, and you consent to all actions we take with respect to your information consistent with our Privacy Policy.

If you choose, or are provided with, a username, password, or any other piece of information as part of our security procedures, you must treat such information as confidential, and you must not disclose it to any other person or entity. You also acknowledge that your account is personal to you and agree not to provide any other person with access to this Services or portions of it using your username, password, or other security information. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to or use of your username or password or any other breach of security. You also agree to ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. You should use particular caution when accessing your account from a public or shared computer so that others are not able to view or record your password or other personal information.

We have the right to disable any username, password, or other identifier, whether chosen by you or provided by us, at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including if, in our opinion, you have violated any provision of these Terms.

#### Submission of Instructions

You must ensure that any Instruction submitted is complete and accurate. We are not required to verify the accuracy, authenticity or validity of any Instruction and will not monitor or reject Instructions on the basis that they are, or appear to be, duplicates. However, if we are in doubt as to the accuracy, authenticity or validity of an Instruction, we may refuse to act upon or defer acting upon any Instruction, or seek further information with respect to the Instruction.

Instructions are irrevocable and therefore once an Instruction has been submitted you have no right to rescind or withdraw it without our written consent. Your Instruction is not deemed to be received by us until it has been received by our server. Our record of all Instructions will be conclusive and binding on you for all purposes.

By submitting an Instruction to initiate the Transaction, you authorize us to credit or debit (or provide information to third parties for the purposes of the third party crediting or debiting) your Digital Assets from your Wallet in accordance with your Instruction. If you have insufficient Digital Assets in your Wallet to effect the Transaction (i.e. less than the required amount to settle the Transaction and to pay all the fees associated with the Transaction), then we have the right to refuse to effect any Transaction. We may also refuse to act on instructions to the extent permitted by these Terms. It is your responsibility to hold sufficient Digital Assets in your Wallet.

You are aware that Instructions and information transmitted on the Platform or by email are generally transmitted via the Internet and may be routed via public, transnational installations which are not specifically protected. We cannot guarantee that the Instructions and information transmitted will be completely protected against unauthorised access, and you accept the associated risks.

#### Transactions

We do not represent or warrant that any actions by you undertaken on the Platform or through the Services (including any Transactions) will be completed successfully or within a specific time period. You agree to permit us (but agree to not require us) to keep a record of all Transaction information as long as it is required to fulfil their intended purposes, or such other period as prescribed by applicable law.

#### Fees and Other Charges

You agree to pay all applicable fees, commissions, interest, charges and other sums in connection with your use of the Services as set out on the Site, or otherwise communicated to you in any relevant Product Terms. Such information on fees forms part of, and are incorporated by reference into these Terms. You authorise us to deduct all applicable fees, commissions, interest, charges and other sums that you owe from your Wallet under these Terms or any Product Terms. If you owe us an amount in one Digital Asset and do not have sufficient assets in that Digital Asset, we may deduct the sums owed in another Digital Asset to effect payment (in which case we will convert the Digital Asset you hold into the Digital Asset in which the sums owed to us are denominated (or the fiat currency equivalent), at the rate currently offered on the Platform or at such other commercially reasonable rate as we may determine). In the event that there are insufficient Digital Assets in your Wallet, you acknowledge that any amount due and payable from you under this clause is a debt immediately due and owing by you to us in such amount and form (whether in the form of a Digital Asset or otherwise) as we may determine, acting in a commercially reasonable manner.

We may adjust our fees from time to time in accordance with the “Changes to the Terms” section above.&#x20;

Any calculations made by Printr in connection with the Services and/or any applicable fees are final and binding on you in the absence of manifest error.&#x20;

#### Representations and Warranties

By accessing and/or using the Services, you represent, warrant and agree that:

* You are an individual, corporation, legal person, entity or other organization (including a decentralized autonomous organisation) with the full power, authority and capacity to (1) access and use the Services; and (2) enter into and comply with your obligations under these Terms (including any Product Terms).

* You do not intend to use the Services to interact or transact with any Restricted Person.&#x20;

* All documents and information you provide to us are true, accurate, complete, and up to date in all respects, and may be relied upon by us in determining whether or not you are eligible to access and/or use Services.&#x20;

#### Material Interests and Conflicts

You understand and agree that neither your relationship with us nor any services we provide to you, nor any other matter, will give rise to any duties on our part or on the part of any of our affiliates, whether legal, equitable, fiduciary in nature, save as are expressly set out in these Terms. In particular, we and any of our affiliates may from time to time act in more than one capacity, and in those capacities we may receive fees or commissions from more than one user (including you). You agree that we may act in such capacities and provide any other services or carry out any business with or for you, any of our affiliates or any other user.

You understand and agree that neither we nor any of our affiliates will be required to: (i) have regard to any information known to us, or to any of our affiliates, which is or may be a material interest; (ii) disclose any such information to you; or (iii) use any such information for your benefit. You further acknowledge that from time to time we may receive general market information in the course of providing access to the Platform to you, which we may use in the ordinary course of our business.

#### Third Party Content

As part of certain Services, you may view, have access to, and may use the informational content, products, or services (“**Third Party Content**” and “**Third Party Services**” respectively) of one or more third parties (“**Third Party Service Providers**”). In each such case, you agree that you view, access or use such content and services at your own election. Your reliance on and use of any Third Party Content and Third Party Services in connection with the Services is governed on one hand by these Terms but, on the other, will also generally be subject to separate terms and conditions set forth by the applicable Third Party Service Providers. Those terms and conditions may involve separate fees and charges or may include disclaimers or risk warnings about reliance on or the accuracy of any information. Such terms may also apply a privacy policy different than that which Printr maintains and incorporates into these Terms. It is your responsibility to understand the terms and conditions in respect of the use of Third Party Content or Third Party Services, including how those Third Party Service Providers use any of your information under their privacy policies.

You access, rely upon or use any Third Party Content or Third Party Service at your own risk. Printr does not guarantee, endorse, or recommend such Third Party Content, Third Party Services or Third Party Service Providers to any or all users of the Services, or the use of such content or services for any particular purpose.

#### Campaigns

Printr may, from time to time, organise reward and marketing campaigns (the “Campaigns”) where you may obtain a chance to receive rewards. All Campaigns are subject to availability and may be changed or terminated by Printr at any time without notice. Printr may, at any time and in its absolute discretion, amend, modify or supplement any terms and conditions or rules associated with any Campaigns. All terms and conditions and rules associated with any Campaigns are incorporated by reference and form part of these Terms. Printr reserves the right to rescind or revoke any distributed rewards or your right to any rewards that have not otherwise been distributed at any time, without prior notice or reason. In the event of rescission or revocation, Printr is not obligated to provide compensation or reimbursement to affected participants.

#### Reliance on Information Posted

Any information (including any content) presented on or through the Services is made available solely for general information purposes. Although we make reasonable efforts to update the information on the Site and the Platform, we make no representations, warranties or guarantees, whether express or implied, that the content on the Site and the Platform, including information in relation to the Services, is accurate, complete or up to date. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, we disclaim all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance placed on such materials by you or any other visitor to the Services, or by anyone who may be informed of any of its contents.

This Services includes content provided by third parties, including materials provided by other users (i.e. User Content) and third-party licensors, syndicators, aggregators, and/or reporting services. All statements and/or opinions expressed in these materials, and all articles and responses to questions and other content, other than the content provided by Printr, are solely the opinions and the responsibility of the person or entity providing those materials. These materials do not necessarily reflect the opinion of Printr. We are not responsible, or liable to you or any third party, for the content or accuracy of any materials provided by any third parties.

#### Links from the Services

If the Services contains links to other sites and resources provided by third parties, these links are provided for your convenience only. This includes links contained in advertisements, including banner advertisements and sponsored links. We have no control over the contents of those sites or resources and accept no responsibility for them or for any loss or damage that may arise from your use of them. If you decide to access any of the third-party websites linked to this Services, you do so entirely at your own risk and subject to the terms and conditions of use for such websites.

#### Disclaimer of Warranties

The Services and any information or content provided on the Site and/or through any Services are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis without any representation or warranty, whether express or implied, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. Specifically, we disclaim any implied warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and/or non-infringement. We do not make any representations or warranties that access to the Site, the Platform, any of the Services, or any of the materials contained therein, will be continuous, uninterrupted, timely or error-free. This could result in the inability to trade on the Platform for a period of time and may also lead to time delays.&#x20;

You are responsible for obtaining the data network access necessary to use the Services. You are responsible for acquiring and updating compatible hardware or devices necessary to access and use the Services, Platform and Site and any updates thereto. We do not guarantee that the Services, or any portion thereof, will function on any particular hardware or devices. The Services may be subject to malfunctions and delays inherent in the use of the internet and electronic communications.

These Terms do not affect any warranties that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.

#### Risk Warning

Please ensure that you read this Risk Warning carefully before you use any of the Services. Note that this Risk Warning does not explain all of the risks that may arise when you use the Services, or how such risks relate to your personal circumstances. It is important that you fully understand the risks involved before deciding to use the Services.&#x20;

#### Market Risks

As with any asset, the value of Digital Assets can fluctuate significantly and there is a material risk of economic loss when buying, selling, holding or investing in Digital Assets. You should therefore consider whether trading or holding Digital Assets is suitable for you in light of your financial circumstances.&#x20;

Digital Asset transactions are speculative and volatile. Supply and demand for Digital Assets can change rapidly without warning and can be affected by a variety of factors which may not be predictable, including regulation, general economic trends and developments in the Digital Asset ecosystem. All Digital Assets transactions carry the risk of loss.

#### Not Investment&#x20;

Digital Assets offered through the Services are primarily for entertainment purposes or for utility within a specified ecosystem or community. Digital Assets are not securities or other financial instruments and should not be bought, sold or held for investment purposes. You must not buy, sell or hold Digital Assets with the expectation of obtaining any returns or profits.

#### Past Performance

Past performance is not an indicator of future performance. Printr does not in any way guarantee or provide any assurance about the performance or market price of Digital Assets or products available through the Services.

#### Counterparty Risk

You may be exposed to counterparty risk in various circumstances when using Services. This may include, without limitation, if a market maker or liquidity provider faces issues which could result in slippage or an inability to execute trades; failures by or disputes with payment processors which may delay deposit and withdrawal transactions; borrowers defaulting on their repayment obligations which may delay the redemption of deposits from certain products. In such other exceptional circumstances, your holdings and your ability to transact or deal with your holdings, may be adversely affected which may result in a range of outcomes including, without limitation, transactions not completing as expected, trading costs being irrecoverable, loss of profits, inability to acquire or dispose of assets at the desired time or price.

#### Liquidity Risk

Digital Asset prices on the secondary market are driven by supply and demand and may be highly volatile. Digital Assets may have limited liquidity which may make it difficult or impossible for you to sell or exit a position when you wish to do so. This may occur at any time, including at times of rapid price movements.

#### No Fiduciary Duties&#x20;

We are not your broker, intermediary, agent or advisor and we have no fiduciary relationship or obligation to you in connection with any transactions or other activities you undertake when using the Services. We do not provide investment or consulting advice of any kind and no communication or information that we provide to you is intended as, or should be construed as, advice of any kind.&#x20;

It is your responsibility to determine whether any transaction is appropriate for you and you are responsible for any associated loss or liability. We do not recommend that any Digital Asset should be bought, earned, sold or held by you. Before making the decision to buy, sell or hold any Digital Asset, you should conduct your own due diligence. We are not responsible for the decisions you make to buy, earn, sell or hold Digital Assets based on the information provided by us, including any losses you incur arising from those decisions.

#### No Tax, Legal or Regulatory Advice

You have sole responsibility for determining what taxes you might be liable to, how and when they apply, and meeting such tax obligations, when transacting through the Services. It is your responsibility to report and pay any taxes that may arise from entering into a Transaction by using the Services, and you acknowledge that we do not provide legal or tax advice in relation to these transactions. If you have any doubts about your tax status or obligations when using Services, or with respect to the Digital Assets held by you, you are encouraged to seek independent advice.

#### Technological and Security Risks

The Services and the Digital Assets rely on emerging technologies, such as cryptographic and blockchain-based technologies. By accessing or using the Services, you understand and agree to the inherent risks associated with cryptographic and blockchain-based technologies, Digital Assets and systems that interact with blockchain-based networks. You agree and understand that Printr does not own or control any of the underlying software through which blockchain networks (such as the Ethereum or Bitcoin blockchain) are formed. In general, the software underlying blockchain networks, is open source, such that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute it. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree (a) that Printr is not responsible for the operation of the blockchain-based software and networks underlying the Services, (b) that there exists no guarantee of the functionality, security, or availability of that software and networks, and (c) that the underlying blockchain-based networks are subject to sudden changes in operating rules, such as Forks, which may materially affect the Services.

The nature of Digital Assets exposes them to an increased risk of cyberattack. There can be no guarantee that systems put in place by us to mitigate cybersecurity threats will always be effective to prevent improper access to the Platform and Digital Assets.  &#x20;

#### Regulatory Risk

You acknowledge and understand that the Services and any Digital Assets you create or acquire through the Services could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability of Printr to continue to make the Services available to you.

#### Third Party Risks

Third parties, such as wallet providers, payment services providers, custodians, and banking partners may be involved in the provision of Services. You may be subject to the terms & conditions of these third parties. Unless expressly provided otherwise, we will not be responsible for any loss that may be incurred by you as a result of or arising from the services provided by such third parties.

#### Limitation on Liability

To the fullest extent provided by law, in no event will Printr, its affiliates, or their licensors, service providers, employees, contractors, agents, officers, or directors be liable for damages of any kind, under any legal theory, arising out of or in connection with your use, or inability to use, the Services, any Services linked to it, any content on the Services or such other services, or any risks as identified in the “Risk Warning” section (as updated from time to time), including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to, personal injury, pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of revenue, loss of profits, loss of business or anticipated savings, loss of use, loss of goodwill, loss of data, and whether caused by tort (including negligence), breach of contract, or otherwise, even if foreseeable.&#x20;

Without prejudice to the foregoing and notwithstanding any other clause in these Terms, in no event will the liability of Printr and its affiliates in aggregate exceed the amount of fees paid by you to Printr in the 12 month period immediately before the event giving rise to the loss. Such sum shall be paid by us to you in full and final settlement and satisfaction of ours and any of our affiliates’ entire liability for any and all losses and claims, howsoever arising, from the relevant events. You acknowledge and agree that neither Printr nor any of our affiliates is aware of any special circumstances pertaining to you, and that damages are an adequate remedy and that you shall not be entitled to any other claims or remedies at law or in equity, including but not limited to, any claim in rem, injunction, and/or specific performance.

These Terms do not affect any liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.

#### Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Printr, its affiliates, licensors, and service providers, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, successors, and assigns from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to your violation of these Terms or your use of the Services, including, but not limited to, your User Content, any use of the Services other than as expressly authorized in these Terms, or your use of any information obtained from the Services.

#### Set-off

In addition to any legal or other remedy available under the Terms or by law, we may set-off any amounts you owe to us under the Terms or otherwise. You must pay all sums that you owe to us free and clear without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding of any kind, save as may be required by applicable law.

#### Governing Law and Jurisdiction

All matters relating to the Services and these Terms, and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Singapore.&#x20;

#### Arbitration

Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms, including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in this clause. The seat of the arbitration shall be Singapore. The Tribunal shall consist of 1 arbitrator. The language of the arbitration shall be English.

#### Waiver and Severability

No waiver by Printr of any term or condition set out in these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Printr to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
